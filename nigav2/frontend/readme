University Landing Pages (Two Project Setup)

This repository contains two separate university landing pages that I built for lead generation. Both pages use modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with smooth animations and fully working contact forms connected to Pipedream for capturing leads.

Page 1 – Himalayan Global University (HGU)

This landing page has a premium visual layout with:

A large hero section with slider animation

Course details

Fees modal

Gallery and campus sections

Smooth scroll and reveal animations

Fully responsive design

A lead submission form connected to Pipedream

The form sends details like name, email, phone, state, course interested, intake year, and a source tag to identify that the lead came from Page 1.

Pipedream webhook used for this page:

Page 2 – National Tech University (NTU)

This landing page has a slightly different design style. It is cleaner and more minimal with:

A simple hero section

Animated program cards

Program details modal

Research and campus sections

Custom animations and transitions

Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

Separate Pipedream webhook for this form

Webhook used for Page 2:

Both forms send JSON data directly to Pipedream using a fetch request.

Deployment Notes

This project is meant to be deployed as a static site.

If using Render:

No server is needed since the form posts directly to Pipedream

These landing pages can also be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel without any adjustments.
